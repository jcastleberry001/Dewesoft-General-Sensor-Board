PCB designed using easyEDA.
This PCB is intended to be used with the following sensor types on Dewesoft's Krypton modules.
-Quarter Bridge
-Full Bridge
-Voltage
-Current
-Potentiometer

A work instruction guide on the bottom of the PCB explains how to connect sensor wires to the board.
A work instruction guide on the top of the PCB explains which way to turn the DIP switches for each sensor type.
One 2 pole screw terminal, and one 3 pole screw terminal is soldered onto the holes at the front of the board.
A D sub 9 male connector is soldered onto the open pads at the back of the board.

This board is intended to be available to quickly test new sensors, before a more permanent board is soldered to the sensor (screw terminals are not ideal for durable sensor leads).
However, if desired, a TEDS chip can also be soldered on to store sensor information so that the Krypton module can recognize the sensor name and calibration info.

History:
9/20/24 - 5 units soldered, waiting for available sensors to confirm operation is OK. Confirmed units are stackable on Krypton module.
